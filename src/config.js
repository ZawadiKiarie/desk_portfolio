I assisted in diagnosing and troubleshooting Electronic Tax Register (ETR) machines, resolving KRA TIMS syncing issues, and supporting clients with device setup and configuration. I also created job cards, learned QuickBooks workflows, and participated in network setup tasks like RJ45 crimping and device configuration. On the development side, I built interfaces and internal tools using VB.NET/WPF, including a PDF Parser application with template editing, modal dialogs, and data table features.",
